tsFramework
===========

The tsFramework is a very fast and simple to use framework written in PHP. It's built after the MVC pattern and uses the newest philosophy in application development. It's modular and plugins are very easy to develop with some hooks in the request/response process of the framework.

Give it a try. And let me know how you feel about it. (I know it's not well documented at the moment but I'll change this in the near future.)

Changelog
---------
### 0.1.0-alpha 
Release of the first version. The framework core is still in development and gets improvements but the "how the framework works" at the moment doesn't change anymore. But propably some features will be added in future releases.
